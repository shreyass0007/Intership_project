- Build interactive user experiences
- Create visually appealing terminal output

## 🚀 Features

✨ Collects 7 different pieces of information:
- Developer's name
- Age
- Favorite programming language/tech hobby
- Years of coding experience
- Annual coding goal
- Dream company/organization
- Cool project idea

🎨 Displays the information in a beautifully formatted profile with:
- Emoji icons for each field
- Professional divider lines
- Organized layout
- Personalized welcome message

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries needed (uses only built-in Python)

## 🏃 How to Run

```

### Method 2: Using Python Interpreter
```bash
python3 Week_1_project.py
```

## 📝 Input Requirements

When prompted, enter the following information:

1. **Name**: Your full name (any string)
2. **Age**: Your age (must be a number)
3. **Tech Hobby**: Your favorite programming language or technology
4. **Experience**: Years of coding experience (any string - can be "0", "1-2", "3+", etc.)
5. **Goal**: Your biggest coding goal for this year
6. **Dream Company**: Company or organization you'd like to work for
7. **Project Idea**: One cool project you'd like to build

## 📤 Sample Output

```
============================================================
✨ Welcome John Doe!
============================================================
🎂 Age: 25 years old
💻 Tech Hobby: Python
📚 Experience: 2 years
🎯 Goal: Build an AI application
🏢 Dream Company: Google
🚀 Cool Project: E-commerce platform
============================================================
Best of luck on your coding journey, John Doe! 🚀💡
```

## 💡 Learning Concepts

This project demonstrates:
- **Input handling**: `input()` function
- **Type conversion**: `int()` for age conversion
- **String formatting**: f-strings for interpolation
- **String manipulation**: Using escape characters like `\n`
- **Console output**: `print()` function with formatting

## 🔧 Possible Enhancements

- Add input validation (e.g., check if age is a valid number)
- Store profiles in a file
- Add multiple user profiles
- Create a database to track developer profiles
- Add skills section to the profile
- Implement data persistence using JSON or CSV
